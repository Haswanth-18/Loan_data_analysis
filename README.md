# Loan_data_analysis
In this project we can anlyze the bank details and personal details of customer and we can segregate the details of customer this will help decision maker to access the loan for the customers.

Loan data analysis is used to seggregate the customer details it will help the bankers to provide loans to the customer easily.
So, I focused on building on time efficient and risk free loan data analysis project.
<h2>ABOUT</h2>

**Motive**

By using this project the entire details about the customers like account number, gender, income,credit_history etc.., are get separated and it also make some graphs according to the given data.
Main motive of this project is to make work easier to the bankers by identifying the customer detailes easily so the bankers able to know the economical capability of the customer easily, Bankers will not get any struggles while providing a loan. 


**Usage of loan data analysis**

1. We have to give data to the code
2. Execute the train data and test data
3. we can able to find the coloumns and rows of the given data
4. By using graphical representation we can find the no.of male and female and also represent the income details in the graphs
   and more.
   
<h2>TECHNOLOGIES USED</h2>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/kamesh0407/stock_market_prediction/blob/main/InteloneAPI.jpg" width="400" height="240" >
</p>

The [Intel® OneAPI toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html#gs.3btkxe), [Intel® OpenVINO toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/openvino-toolkit/overview.html) enables models to be trained in a more efficient way and results in faster training times. ADAM optimization algorithm is used and a MSE loss function is optimized.


<h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
<li>I have used algorithms and machine learning models in this process
</li>
<li> Used machine learning models are: Logistic regression, Random forest, XGboost, Decision tree</li>
