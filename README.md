# Loan_data_analysis
In this project we can anlyze the bank details and personal details of customer and we can segregate the details of customer this will help decision maker to access the loan for the customers.

Loan data analysis is used to seggregate the customer details it will help the bankers to provide loans to the customer easily.
So, I focused on building on time efficient and risk free loan data analysis project.
<h2>ABOUT</h2>

**Motive**

By using this project the entire details about the customers like account number, gender, income,credit_history etc.., are get separated and it also make some graphs according to the given data.
Main motive of this project is to make work easier to the bankers by identifying the customer detailes easily so the bankers able to know the economical capability of the customer easily, Bankers will not get any struggles while providing a loan. 


**Usage of loan data analysis**

1. We have to give data to the code
2. Execute the train data and test data
3. we can able to find the coloumns and rows of the given data
4. By using graphical representation we can find the no.of male and female and also represent the income details in the graphs
   and more.
<h2>TECHNOLOGIES USED</h2>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/kamesh0407/stock_market_prediction/blob/main/InteloneAPI.jpg" width="400" height="240" >
</p>

The [Intel® OneAPI toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html#gs.3btkxe), [Intel® OpenVINO toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/openvino-toolkit/overview.html) enables models to be trained in a more efficient way and results in faster training times. ADAM optimization algorithm is used and a MSE loss function is optimized.





<h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
<li>The model was trained using Google's stock market data(Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) to enhance its technical proficiency.
</li>
<li>  The keras model helps to create a model, layer by layer. The dense layer is fully connected layer, so all the neurons in a layer are connected to those in a next layer by using tensorflow as a backend.</li>
<br/>

**LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY NETWORK:**
 LTSMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network for learning long-term dependencies.
It is commonly used for processing and predicting time-series data.

<h2>PLATFORMS</h2>


**CODES IN DIFFERENT PLATFORMS:**

It tooks nearly 48seconds to 58 seconds to run single keras model files in Jupyter n0tebook
But in OPENVINO it took 135 milliseconds to 141 milliseconds to run it where this keras model consist of 100 files to run it and make to fit for the model.
